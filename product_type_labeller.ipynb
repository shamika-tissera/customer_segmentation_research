    "These goods are easily accessible in the market, and the rate of purchase is quite frequent. For instance, Toothpaste, toilet paper, drinks, food, deodorants, consumer packaged goods, etc. The highlighting characteristics are as follows:Not durable, Easy availability The rate of purchase is frequent, Relatively low priced)\n",
    "- Unsought (These kinds of products can be ranked from old, outdated goods to the new innovative prototype. Consumers don’t remember these products at the top of their heads, and they are very infrequently bought from the market. The unique property of this good is that the benefits are not instantly derived from the product. For instance, Life Insurance is the most popular unsought good in the market. The highlighting characteristics are as follows: The rate of purchase is infrequent, The consumers are unaware of the features of the product, Lack of desire, Bought to avoid an undesirable outcome)\n",
    "- Shopping (The purchase rate in the case of shopping products is not as frequent as in the case of convenience goods. They are also not readily available in the market. So, as a result, consumers take time to conclude whether to go ahead with the purchase or not. For instance, Clothing, Mobile phones, and sofa sets are all shopping goods that are consumed on local as well as global scale. The highlighting characteristics are as follows: They are durable goods, Comparable to related goods, The rate of purchase is infrequent, Opportunity cost is high, Less availability)\n",
    "- Specialty (The consumers’ decision time during the purchase of specialty goods is minimum. Since specialty goods have rare features and unique designs and they don’t have homogenous products. For instance, designer clothing, high specification laptop, sports car, rare ornaments, etc. The brand image in the market is the USP of these products like Ferrari, Gucci, etc. The highlighting characteristics are as follows: Goods are durable, They are rare to find, The purchase rate is infrequent, They are extravagantly priced)\n",
